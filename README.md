#### BASE CONVERTER AND ARITHMETIC OPERATOR 	
			
			
			
A simple Python 3.x project that operate on numbers with bases from 2 to 16. First module of project
converts the inputs in any base (2 -16) using special algorithms like:

```
  ~ substitution 

  ~ successive divisions 

  ~ to use an intermediate base (that's 10)

  ~ quickly convertion among 2, 4, 8 or 16 bases
```

The second module computes basic operations between inputs :
```
~ adding 2 numbers that share the same base or a different one

~ substraction of 2 numbers that share the same base or a different one

~ multiplying of a number with a digit

~ dividing a number by a digit
  ```
